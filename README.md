## Features

- **User Auth**: Users can authenticate using JWTs.
- **Subreddits**: Users can view and create subreddits.
- **Posts**: Users can post to specific subreddits.
- **Comments**: Users can comment on posts and other comments.
- **Voting**: Users can upvote and downvote posts and comments.
- **Filtering**: Users can sort posts and comments by "Hot," "New," and "Top."

## Highlights

- **Efficient Data Fetching**: Uses `Promise.all` to handle multiple asynchronous queries for posts and comments, reducing overall load time.
- **Post Ranking**: Implements precomputed ranking scores (`rankingScore`, `netUpvotes`) to sort content efficiently based on "Hot," "New," and "Top" filters.
- **Database Throughput**: The application is designed to handle heavy read/write loads and supports the following throughput:
  - **8,000+ Transactions per Second (TPS)** for reads (screen views)
  - **5,500+ TPS** for page views
  - **1,000+ TPS** for upvotes
  - **10+ TPS** for post creation
  - A MongoDB sharding strategy is employed to distribute data across clusters (Posts/Subreddits, Votes, Comments, Users), ensuring scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Caching with Redis**: Implemented Redis for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., hot posts and comments) to further reduce load times and optimize performance.
- **Recursive Comment Fetching**: Server-side logic recursively fetches deeply nested comment threads, enabling seamless user interactions with replies and discussions.
- **Reusability**: Frontend components such as a `PaginatedList` can handle paginated views of different data (posts, comments, replies) for scalability.
- **Version & Security Updates**: Code is regularly updated to the latest package versions, resolving security vulnerabilities.

## Usage

The application supports Reddit-like functionality, including:

- Viewing, posting, and voting on posts.
- Threaded commenting with replies.
- Pagination and filtering of posts and comments, ranked using a custom algorithm for "Hot," "New," and "Top."

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                    | Description                                       |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/posts`                | Fetch all posts (supports pagination & filtering) |
| POST   | `/api/posts`                | Creates a new post                                |
| GET    | `/api/comments`             | Fetch top-level comments with pagination          |
| POST   | `/api/comments`             | Creates a new comment                             |
| GET    | `/api/comments/:id/replies` | Fetch replies to a specific comment               |
| POST   | `/api/votes`                | Creates a vote on a comment or post               |

## Database Design and Scalability

### Current Setup

The application currently uses a single MongoDB cluster managed by MongoDB Atlas with the following collections:

- **Users**
- **Posts**
- **Subreddits**
- **PostSubs** (a join table for posts and subreddits)
- **Comments**
- **Votes**

### Sharding Strategy

To prepare for scalability, I’m leveraging MongoDB’s built-in sharding features. For the traffic and workload outlined, sharding data across multiple clusters is crucial for scaling effectively. Here's the planned approach:

- **Posts & Subreddits**: Will be moved to a dedicated cluster with sharding based on `subredditId`. This ensures the high volume of post reads and writes is balanced.
- **Votes**: A separate cluster will handle vote data, partitioned by `postId`. With over 1,000 TPS for votes, this ensures fast, independent scaling.
- **Comments**: Managed in its own cluster, sharded by `postId`, since comments heavily depend on the posts they belong to and can grow recursively.
- **Users**: Stored in another cluster for user-related activities and data, sharded by `userId`.

This design isolates different high-traffic components of the application, reducing potential bottlenecks and optimizing for the read-heavy nature of the app. Given MongoDB's flexibility, the solution will allow the system to scale linearly as the user base grows.

---

For example:

```javascript
// Sharding keys for each collection:

db.posts.createIndex({ subredditId: 1 });
db.votes.createIndex({ postId: 1 });
db.comments.createIndex({ postId: 1 });
db.users.createIndex({ userId: 1 });
```

Each collection is sharded on the appropriate keys to handle heavy traffic efficiently, preventing read/write contention across different aspects of the platform.

## Pagination & Filtering

The app supports several filtering and pagination strategies to optimize performance:

- **Posts**:
  - Posts can be filtered by `Hot`, `New`, and `Top` categories.
  - Pagination relies on MongoDB query strategies (`.sort()`, `.limit()`), using precomputed scores for ranking.
- **Comments**:
  - Recursive server-side logic fetches nested comments, allowing deep-threaded conversations.
  - Comments are paginated, with dynamic filtering for reply counts and voting activity.

## Performance Optimizations

To ensure the app performs efficiently even with high traffic, the following optimizations have been incorporated:

- **Memoization**:
  - Using `useCallback` and `useMemo` to minimize unnecessary re-renders.
  - Leveraging Reselect’s `createSelector` to memoize `useSelector` calls in React.
- **Efficient Querying**:

  - `Promise.all` handles concurrent requests, improving response times when fetching multiple data sources.
  - Mongoose’s `.lean()` is used to return lightweight, plain JavaScript objects, reducing memory overhead.

- **Lazy Loading**:
  - Components are lazy-loaded with `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`, improving initial page load times and reducing bandwidth consumption.

## Technologies

- **MongoDB**: Used for database management with a sharding strategy to optimize scalability across posts, comments, votes, and users.
- **Express**: Server framework for handling API requests and routing.
- **React**: Frontend library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime for executing JavaScript on the server.
- **Redis**: Implemented as a caching layer to store frequently accessed data and reduce response times for read-heavy operations.
- **Mongoose**: ORM for MongoDB, used for schema definitions and efficient query handling.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure authentication of users.

## Future Plans

- Refactor for deployment on AWS Lambda.
- Explore using DynamoDB for further scalability and flexibility.
- Implement server-side caching and load balancing.
- Add CDN integration for faster content delivery.
- Implement user profiles with vote and post history.
- Expand validation and security features.
- Overhaul frontend design for a smoother, more intuitive experience.
